# ExoCurve
Tools for studying exoplanets

This will be a re-write and expansion of my KepCurve tools for the Kepler mission. The intention is that it supports the following features:
- Maintain a database of stars, observations and planets
- Viewing light curves and providing dispositions on activity and transits
- Viewing RV curves and their periodograms, and providing dispositions on trends and significant periods
- Portals to online resources such as Simbad
- Tools for stellar characterisation (polynomial photometry models, isochrone fitting, etc) 
- Tools for light curve analysis (detrending, transit marking, transit analysis, TTV analysis, etc)
- Tools for RV analysis (Gaussian process MCMC fitting)

Obviously, this is a lot of stuff, so I expect to release this in stages:
- First release: a light curve and RV viewer, with Simbad lookup but minimal analysis tools
- Others TBD

Licensing:
- The source code will be provided as-is with no guarantees
